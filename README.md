# Capstone-Project

My goal is to develop a better code tutorial for a less technical audience. 
A desktop application written in Java will be used to accomplish this goal. 
There will be multiple coding concepts taught using a variety of techniques facilitated through levels. 
Every level focuses on one concept and is random in some way. 
The answers are randomly generated with different prompts so that the answers cannot be memorized. 
Through this program, less technical audiences can gain a basic understanding of coding. 
The software will also enable a better channel of communication with developers.
